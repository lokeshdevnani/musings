- **Home base:** Bangalore. Often between Ajmer and Bangalore.
- On a **sabbatical** — taking deliberate time to train, build, and explore outside a full-time job.
- Completed **200-hour Yoga Teacher Training (RYT-200)**; integrating breath, alignment, and awareness into how I move and teach.
- Deepening practice in **contemporary dance and other movement practices**. Occasionally teaching in Bangalore — DM to host a workshop or book a 1:1 (acroyoga, floorwork, dance, soft acrobatics, improvisation).
- **[dhol.dance](https://dhol.dance/)** — building a beat-making app for dancers and non-musicians.
- **MastiDB** — building a fun OLAP database engine in Python.
- **[@improvise.dance](https://instagram.com/improvise.dance)** — documenting outdoor improvisations and movement experiments; inviting people to improvise and build a friendly practice anywhere.
- **Currently learning:** music (theory, keys, finger drumming, mixing), psychology, distributed systems.
- **Availability:** open to interesting projects and collaborations when there’s a good fit.

Open to conversations around **body × tech × AI x inner work**.
